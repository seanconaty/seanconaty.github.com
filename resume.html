        I worked on a cross-functional team responsible for building and maintaining features of the web client. I added and updated backend models and API endpoints for the management of school memberships and user roles. I built the UI components for searching, creating and managing school memberships. I worked on key growth initiatives for the back-to-school campaign.

        Technologies used include a Ruby on Rails REST API, React, SCSS, ES6, GraphQL.

        As an early (&lt;10 people) startup employee, I was responsible for designing and building features end-to-end.

        I implemented a drag &amp; drop calendar for scheduling events, including a new back-end API that improved page load time by &gt;300% by optimizing queries. I conducted user tests which verified that the experience was better because it offered more context and the time that it took to schedule an item was much faster.
        </p><p>
        I spearheaded the development of internal company admin pages and built a light-weight jQuery plugin for paging and sorting which made it easy for other developers to reuse. This site ultimately grew to 42 different types of object collections. These pages became crucial for allowing non-technical employees to troubleshoot the application and address customer inquiries.
        </p><p>
        I participated in the on-call engineering rotation and worked with the Customer Success team to triage customer issues and identify workarounds. Where possible, I identified areas for improvement and built tools to make issue diagnosis faster.
        </p><p>
        I advocated and implemented front-end best practices and educated the team by creating living style guide. I migrated the site from using no CSS framework to using Bootstrap. The switch resulted in the removal of 3000 lines of CSS and a more consistent look and feel.
